                        I work from observation, memory, and accident. Figures hunch, reach, or
                        dissolve into the space around them; heads become bowls, coats stand in
                        for missing bodies, architecture tilts into shadow. The surfaces are
                        reworked and scraped back—nothing is too fixed, everything is in process.

                            Many of the paintings begin with the figure: a back turned away, a
                            crouched body on a bed, someone leaning into the dark. I’m interested
                            less in likeness and more in posture—how a body can read as tired,
                            alert, devotional, or absent with just a few marks.

                            Other works drift toward interiors and city scenes: doorways, corridors,
                            figures slipping in and out of frame. Sometimes the head becomes a
                            container or a landscape. The paintings sit between narrative and
                            abstraction, like a half-remembered moment you can’t quite place.

                            I take on a small number of commissions each year. The work stays
                            close to my studio practice—gestural, slightly uneasy, somewhere
                            between figure and space. Think of it as inviting a particular kind
                            of painting into your life, rather than ordering an illustration.

                            I’m a painter living and working in New York City, currently
                            completing my MFA. The work grows out of long sessions with the
                            figure, drawings in the street, and a lot of repainting. I’m drawn to
                            awkward poses, half-lit corners, and images that feel like they’re
                            arriving and erasing themselves at the same time.

                            Surfaces are built slowly: thin scrapes of color next to thick
                            ridges of paint, muddy browns against sour greens, bruised pinks and
                            asphalt blues. I’m interested in how much a scene can be reduced
                            before it falls apart—and how far it can be pushed without losing the
                            sense of a body or a place.
